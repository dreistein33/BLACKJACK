This is the simple game of blackjack written in Python3.

I have written it that way to see how would it work if i used instances of classes inside other classes.

Conclusions:
1) I find that way harder to read.
2) Focusing on readibility and simplicity is very crucial in writing programs.

How to run:
1) clone this repo -> git clone repo.git
2) run -> python3 main.py in terminal

Have fun!
